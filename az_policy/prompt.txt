In Azure I have a resource group called 'LibertyMutualDemo'. In that RG I have two Recovery Services Vaults:

- lm-hourly
- lm-daily

The backup policy is called 'EnhancedPolicy'

When I deploy a Virtual Machine into that Resource Group, It will have a tag with the key, 'backup-policy', 
the value will either be 'daily' or 'hourly'. For the VMs tagged with 'daily', I want them to be assigned to
the 'EnhancedPolicy' policy on lm-daily. The VMs tagged with hourly will be assigned to 'lm-hourly' and the
'EnhancedPolicy' policy as well.
